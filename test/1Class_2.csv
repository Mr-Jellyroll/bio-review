Weather-dependent Limitation (Yosemite toad): If there is a 70% or greater forecasted rain event of 0.25-inch or greater, work activities will be postponed until site conditions are dry. Yosemite Toad WEAP Training: All field crew members must have received Yosemite toad WEAP training before performing work. This training includes information about how to identify Yosemite toads, habitat requirements, and resource protection measures to ensure crews avoid or minimize adverse impacts. Attendance must be tracked and reported to the Environmental Services Department. Schedule Limitation (Yosemite Toad): No work will occur within the 60-day dispersal period (determined annually each spring by the SNF Aquatic Biologist). Contact the Environmental Services Department for this date. When possible, operations should be completed by October 1 to minimize interference with Yosemite toad overwintering migrations and hibernation. Contact Environmental Services if you are unable to comply with the schedule limitations described in this measure. Dry Soil Conditions (Yosemite toad): Work must be conducted in daylight and during dry conditions. Between April 15 and November 15, all work activities will cease for 48 hours after a rain event (not applicable to winter months/hibernation periods) if within occupied habitat or if crossing through (including roads) known occupied Yosemite toad habitat. Activities will be postponed until site conditions are dry enough to avoid potential impacts on Yosemite toad. A biological monitor must determine when conditions are dry enough for work to proceed. Debris Management in Toad Habitat: Materials from vegetation management will be removed or properly disposed of in a way that does not create dispersal barriers for Yosemite toads. No dispersal of chips and no lop and scatter in YOTO habitat. Logs left on site will be assessed by a YOTO monitor to determine if dispersal barrier mitigations are needed. Pre-Activity Notification: Email District aquatic biologist, Stephanie Barnes, CC: Chung “Cissy” Jordan, Jack Goldfarb, and AnneMarie Ruane prior to the work start. Written approval from the District aquatic biologist is required. Monitoring Reporting: All areas patrolled or visited that overlap occupied Yosemite toad occupied habitat will have a brief email summary report completed after work has been implemented that will include information such as the date of survey work, the amount of habitat avoided (i.e. number of habitat areas flagged), unintended impacts to habitats (i.e. stepping on rodent burrows), individual toads observed and avoided, and general habitat overview.
